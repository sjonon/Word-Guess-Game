//Variables
Array containing names for the guessing game

Random word from the array is selected
on key press if the key matches a letter in the word display letter (are we hiding these letters using CSS and then unhiding them??)
    if not then display letter under letters guessed and decrease guesses remaining count

if word is guessed correctly (all letters are unhidden)
then change picture, update win count and play sound
